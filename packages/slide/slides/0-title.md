<!-- note
Good evening everyone!
My name is Toru Kobayashi.
I'm here to show you how to "Make it Declarative with React"

I'm sure that many developers use React to build single page applications.
But you might not know that React has some interesting usecases other than for building user interfaces.
I'm going to show you some ideas using React, which I've learned while contributing to React.

Before going over the agenda, I'd like to quickly introduce myself in more detail.

このトークは英語で行いますが、日本語でも補足を入れていきます。
