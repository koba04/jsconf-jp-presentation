<!-- note
Good evening everyone!
My talk is "Make it Declrative with React"

This is my first conference talk in English!
So I'm a little nervous...

I guess many developers use React to build single page applications.
But you might not know React has some interesting usecases not only building an user interface.
I'm going to show you ideas using React, those are what I've learned through contributing React.
