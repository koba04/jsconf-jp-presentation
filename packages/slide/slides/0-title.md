<!-- note
Good evening everyone!
My name is Toru.
I'm here to show you how to "Make it Declrative with React"

I'm sure that many developers use React to build single page applications.
But you might not know that React has some interesting usecases not only for building a user interface.
I'm going to show you some ideas using React, which I've learned while contributing to React.

Before going over the agenda, I'd like to quickly introduce myself.
