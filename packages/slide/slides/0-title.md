<!-- note
Good evening everyone!
My name is Toru.
I'm here to show you how "Make it Declrative with React"

This is my first conference talk in English!
So I'm a little nervous...

I guess many developers use React to build single page applications.
But you might not know that React has some interesting usecases not only for building an user interface.
I'm going to show you ideas using React, those are what I've learned when contributing to React.

Before going over the agenda, I'd like to introduce myself.
