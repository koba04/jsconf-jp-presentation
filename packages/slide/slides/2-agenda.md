# Agenda

<!-- note

I've divided my talk into 3 parts.

First, I'm going to talk about the benefits of Declarative Programing for UI.
It's a fundamental concept of React so I'd like to introduce the benefits and comparison with Imperative Programming.

Second, I'm going to describe what React custom renderer is and how to create a custom renderer.
I'm also going to explan the internal architecture of React.

Finally, I'm going to give a live demo on how to create a custom renderer with a tiny custom renderer.
