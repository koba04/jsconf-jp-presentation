本日のアジェンダです

I've divided my talk into 3 parts.

First, I'll be talking about the benefits of Declarative Programing for UI.
It's a fundamental concept of React so I'd like to introduce the benefits and comparison with Imperative Programming.

Second, I'll be describing what React custom renderer is and how to create a custom renderer.
I'll also be explaning the internal architecture of React.

Finally, I'll be giving a live demo on how to create a custom renderer.
