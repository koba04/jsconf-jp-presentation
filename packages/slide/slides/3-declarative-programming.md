# Declarative Programming for UI

---------------

<!-- note
According to Wikipedia, Declarative Programming is described like this.

I think "the logic of a computation without describing its control flow" and "describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain" are important to describe what Declarative Programming is.

-->

# Declarative Programming

> In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigmâ€”a style of building the structure and elements of computer programsâ€”that expresses **the logic of a computation without describing its control flow**.

> Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by **describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain**, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming

---------------

<!-- note
This is the description cited from the Desclarative section in the official website of React.

The documentation says that "Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug"
TODO: something

We can also see declarative programming in other programming languages.
-->

# Declarative in React

> React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

> **Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug**.

<!-- note
SwiftUI is a new UI framework by Apple.
SwiftUI is similar to React, it describes views declaratively.
TODO: something
-->

# SwiftUI

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Content: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello")
                .font(.title)
            Text("World!")
                .font(.body)
        }
    }
}
```

<!-- note
I don't talk about SwitUI today,
So if you are interested in SwiftUI I recommend to watch the video of SwiftUI Essentilals.
You can see many similar concepts with React on the video.

if you are intested in managing data on applications, I also recommend to watch the video of Data Flow Through SwiftUI.
SwiftUI has some interesting ideas to manage data like Bindable Object, Environment Object.

<!-- note
With Declarative Programming, you write what you want to do rather than how you want to do it.
How to do is a job for a compiler, not for you.

TODO: it's not clear
It also creates an abstraction layer that is declarative.
It hides an underlying layer how to do it so a compiler can optimize the underlying layer.
In addition to that, you can define primitives in the declarative layer as domain logic.
So it makes possible to provide a high level abstraction.
-->

# Why Declarative?

- what you want to do, not how you want to do it
    - How to do is a job of compiler
- It's an abstraction layer
    - Be able to optimize in the underlying the layer
    - Your domain as a primitive

---------------

<!-- note
I'm going to focus on the sentence.
"The logic of a computation without describing its control flow"
-->


# The logic of a computation without describing its control flow

---------------

<!-- note
For application running on browsers, DOM is a primitive and you would write DOM manipurations to update your views.
As you may know, DOM manipuration is based on imperative operations.
-->

# DOM manipuration is based on imperative operations

---------------

<!-- note
Let's take an example to update a view when a button is clicked.

You whould write a DOM manipuration in the event listener of the click event.
This is an imperative operation and describes how to update the view, not what the view should be.
-->

# Imperative

Decribing how to update the view

```js
const view = document.querySelector('.view');
const addButton = document.querySelector('.add-button');

// You have to implement how to update the view
addButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    view.appendChild(child)
});
```

---------------

<!-- note
These are imperative operations.

TODO: unclear
They change the DOM based on the caller DOM objects so the results depends on the caller itself not only the arguments.
appendChild appends the argument into the caller view object.
removeChild remvoves the argument from the caller view object.
insertBefore appends the 1st argument before the 2nd argument.
-->

# Imperative

- `view.appendChild(child)`
- `view.removeChild(child)`
- `view.insertBefore(child, child2)`
- ...

---------------

<!-- note
Let's look at Declarative version.

This becomes longer than the imperative version.

I've separated updating the state and displaying the view.
the render function is displaying the view, which describes what the view should be, not how to update the view.
So the render function is declarative, which is based on the passed state.
Of course, we still need an imperative operation to update the state but the updating the state part is now separated from the view.
-->

# Declarative

Describing what to update the view

```js
const view = document.querySelector('.view');
const addButton = document.querySelector('.add-button');
const state = [];

addButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // update the state impleratively
    state.push(child);
    // describe the view declaratively based on the state
    render(state);
});

// describing what the view should display
const render = state => {
    view.innerHTML = state.map(s => `<span>${s}</span>`).join('');
}
```

---------------

<!-- note
This is an application with React.

This is of course declarative.
This includes how to update the state, but doesn't include how to update the view.
So the view is only based on the state. If the state is the same, the view must be the same, which means that we can only focus on the state.

the view is a mirror of the state
-->

# Declarative with React

```js
const view = document.querySelector('.view');

// describing what the view should display
const App = () => {
    const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
    return (
        <Layout>
            <Header>title</Header>
            <ItemList>
                {items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} item={item} />)}
            </ItemList>
            <AddItem onAddItem={(item) => {
                setItems(items.concat(item));
            }} />
        </Layout>
    );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, view);
```

---------------

<!-- note
You can update a state imperatively and you can update a view declaratively.

- easy to test
    State is a JavaScript object and the view is described declaratively.
    Mutation is only for state, not for views, which means we can write tests for state and view easily.
- reuseable
    Because updating a state and describing a view are loose coupled.
- `ðŸ‘€ = View(State)`
    View is just a function.
    React components are basically just idempotent functions.
    You can think just like a server-rendered app.
    You can think as data driven way and treat the state as single source of the truth.
-->

# Benefits

- Easy to test
    - State is just a JavaScript object
- Reusable
    - View is loose coupled from the state
- ðŸ‘€ = View(State)
    - View is just an idempotent function

<!-- note

# But....

Do you create an entire view each updates...?

You have to keep track of scroll position and focus management and so on, don't you?

# React updates view efficiently

- a.k.a Virtual DOM

```js
let count = 1;
ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
        <Header />
        <p>{count}</p>
        <Footer />
    </div>,
    container
);

count = 2;
ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
        <Header />
        <p>{count}</p>
        <Footer />
    </div>,
    container
)
// React update the DOM like the following
// p.textContent = 2;
```

----------------------

<!-- note

-->

# Change the index in a list

```js
ReactDOM.render(
    <ul>
        <li key="a">a</li>
        <li key="b">b</li>
        <li key="c">c</li>
    </ul>,
    container
);

ReactDOM.render(
    <ul>
        <li key="b">b</li>
        <li key="a">a</li>
        <li key="c">c</li>
    </ul>,
    container
)
// React update the DOM like the following
// li.removeChild(b);
// li.insertBefore(b, a);
```

----------------------

<!-- note

-->

# What React does

React interprets diffs for updates and transforms the diffs to imperative operations

```text
Component ... Declarative

â†“ <div>hello</div>

React ... Imperative

â†“ div.textContent = 'hello';

ðŸ‘€
```

----------------------

<!-- note

-->

# So

- You dont' have to write how to chage the view
- Describe what the view should be

----------------------

<!-- note

-->

# Describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain

----------------------

<!-- note

-->

# Abstract your application components

- DOM is an implementation detail
- You can build own domain layers for your application on top of any hosts not only DOM

----------------------

<!-- note
React provides an abstraction layer for DOM operations,
But you can create own abstraction layer like this.

DOM might be too low level your application. So you can build your component layer on top of DOM.
-->

# Build own domain layers with React

```js
const view = document.querySelector('.view');

// describing what the view should display
const App = () => {
    const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
    return (
        <Layout>
            <Header>title</Header>
            <ItemList>
                {items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} item={item} />)}
            </ItemList>
            <AddItem onAddItem={(item) => {
                setItems(items.concat(item));
            }} />
        </Layout>
    );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, view);
```
